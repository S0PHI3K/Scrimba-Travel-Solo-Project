# Scrimba-Travel-Solo-Project

In this project I have consolidated my learning on the use of props and using .map()

Supporting projects I also built during the Scrimba module include [Scrimba Joke Project](https://github.com/S0PHI3K/Scrimba-Joke-Project) and [Scrimba AirBnB Project](https://github.com/S0PHI3K/Scrimba-AirBnB-Project)
